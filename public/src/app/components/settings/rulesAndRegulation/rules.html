                    </p>
                    <p>If for any reason the Service is not running as originally planned (e.g., if the Service becomes corrupted or does not allow the proper usage and processing of entries in accordance with the rules, or if infection by a computer virus,

                        You agree that participation in and (where applicable) the winning of a prize in connection with a contest constitute complete compensation for your obligations under this paragraph, and you agree not to seek to charge a fee or
                        impose other conditions on the fulfillment of these obligations. The rules specific to certain contests may contain additional publicity obligations or may require a written signature on a separate publicity waiver.
                    </p>
                    <h5>6. Prizes / Gifts</h5>
                    <p>After each contest ends, the tentative winners are announced (generally by the following day) but remain subject to final verification. The players in each contest who accumulate the most points and comply with eligibility requirements
                        and applicable rules will win prizes as set out in the posted contest details. In the event of a tie, the prize is divided evenly between the tied players, or similar prizes of equal value are provided to the tied players, unless
                        otherwise specified.
                    </p>
                    <p>Prize calculations are based on the results as of the time when final scoring is tabulated by Fantumn. Once winners are initially announced by Fantumn, the scoring results will not be changed in light of official adjustments made by
                        the professional leagues, though we reserve the right to make adjustments based on errors or irregularities in the transmission of information to us from our stats provider or in our calculation of results. We also may make adjustments
                        in the event of noncompliance with the Terms. Fantumn has no obligation to delay the awarding of a prize in anticipation of any adjustment.
                    </p>
                    <p>No substitution or transfer of a prize is permitted. All taxes associated with the receipt or use of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of any prizes to winners of the Contest is challenged
                        by any legal authority, Fantumn reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether or not to award or adjust such prizes. In all disputes arising out of the determination of the winner of Fantumn contests, Fantumn actions
                        are final and binding.</p>
                    <p>Once winners are initially announced by Fantumn, the scoring results will not be changed in light of official adjustments made by the professional leagues, though we reserve the right to make adjustments based on errors or irregularities
